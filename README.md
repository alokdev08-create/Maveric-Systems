 You are part of a team that explores the bottom of the sea using a remotely controlled submersible probe. Develop a REST API that allows control of the probe from the surface using a set of interpreted controls.

 

Requirements

You have a defined grid representing the ocean floor where location can be identified using x/y co-ordinates
You are given an initial starting point (x, y) for the probe and the direction it is facing
The probe will receive a collection of commands
It should be able to:
Move forwards and backwards
Turn left and right
Stay on the grid
Avoid obstacles in the grid
Print a summary of the co-ordinates visited
 

Things we are looking for:

It is highly desired that the code has been test driven

Clean code
Edge case consideration
Object orientation
Git history
 

Things we value:

Simple, elegant code that reads like a narrative
Thinking about the code more than writing it
Tests that read like they were written as documentation of the code in the first place
 

Thing required to proceed forward

1. Complete the Unit testing

2. Write the test cases successfully

3. Please write the code in TDD (Test Driven Development) approach â€“ First you need to write test cases, then you need to implement the code that should be incremental commits to see GIT history.
